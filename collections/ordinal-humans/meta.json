  "description": "In the heart of the dark forest, there were whispers of an ancient evil. Some said that long ago, a group of 100 humans had entered the forest and became trapped, unable to escape the curse that hit them. These humans had turned into twisted, dead creatures and their minds consumed by madness. They had become known as the "Ordinal Humans" and their only desire was to kill anyone who dared to enter the forest.",
